# TheEnd Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for TheEnd, a music rhythm game.

## Phase 1: Core Engine and Visuals

*   **Project Setup:** Initialize a Vue.js project.
*   **Rendering Engine:** Implement a rendering engine for basic geometric shapes (squares, lines, rhombuses) using HTML5 Canvas or WebGL.
*   **Effects System:** Develop a system for glow and bloom effects to enhance the visuals.
*   **Gameplay Screen:** Create the basic gameplay screen with a dynamic judgment line.

## Phase 2: Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Note Types:** Implement the four note types: tap, slide, hold, and "yellow bar".
*   **Judgment System:** Develop the logic for note judgment (e.g., Perfect, Good, Miss).
*   **Dynamic Judgment Line:** Implement the movement of the judgment line based on the chart.
*   **Scoring and Progress:** Add a basic scoring system and a progress bar.

## Phase 3: UI/UX and Menus

*   **Main Menu:** Design and implement the main menu with a "crystalline" aesthetic.
*   **Song Selection:** Create the song selection screen, displaying charts as a grid of albums.
*   **Settings Screen:** Implement a settings screen for adjusting volume, note speed, background brightness, and audio offset.
*   **In-Game UI:** Design and implement the in-game UI, including the score display, progress bar, and pause button.

## Phase 4: Chart Editor (Workshop)

*   **Editor Core:** Develop the core functionality of the chart editor.
*   **Note Placement:** Allow for the placement and editing of all note types on a timeline.
*   **Synchronization:** Implement audio and timeline synchronization.
*   **Chart Data:** Allow for the import of music and cover art, and the export of chart data.

## Phase 5: Platform Specifics (Android)

*   **Optimization:** Optimize the game for performance on mobile devices.
*   **Touch Controls:** Implement responsive touch controls.
*   **Deployment:** Package the application for Android.

# Art Style: Gray + White Dark Aesthetic

The visual style of TheEnd will be minimalist, high-contrast, and effects-driven, built on a foundation of gray and white.

*   **Core Palette:** The primary colors will be shades of gray and white, with black for deep backgrounds. A single, vibrant accent color (e.g., deep red, cyan) can be used for highlights, effects, and key UI elements to create a striking, high-contrast look.
*   **Geometric Primitives:** The entire visual identity will be built from squares, lines, and rhombuses. These will be used for everything from UI elements and buttons to particle effects and note animations.
*   **Glow and Bloom:** A key element of the art style will be the heavy use of glow and bloom effects. This will make the geometric shapes feel like they are emitting light, creating a futuristic, ethereal, and "high-end" atmosphere.
*   **Animation:** Micro-animations will be used to bring the UI and gameplay to life. Floating crystals, pulsing lines, and other subtle animations will create a sense of dynamism and polish.
*   **High Contrast and "Light Pollution":** The use of a limited color palette with strong value differences will be key. Bright white UI elements on a dark gray background will create a clean, readable, and impactful look. The "light pollution" effect can be achieved by layering multiple glow and bloom effects, creating a visually rich and immersive experience.
